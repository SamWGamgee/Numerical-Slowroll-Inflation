ICTP PWF: Physics for Bangladesh Online Summer Internship (https://indico.ictp.it/event/11042)

**Supervisor:** Rafid Mahbub, Ph.D. in Physics, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities 

**Project Title:** _Numerical analysis of inflationary ɑ-attractor models_


Building on the my basics of GR and Cosmology attained from PWF Bangladesh: School on General Relativity and Cosmology (https://indico.ictp.it/event/11010/), I studied inflationary backgrounds and quantum fluctuations, and developed a Python package to automatically generate numerical results for arbitrary slow-roll models. 

Open to suggestions about how to improve and refine this package for more complex types of inflationary models.
